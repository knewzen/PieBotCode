# PieBotCode.
This is the open source code for the very unknown Discord Bot "PieBot". Don't even try to self host. It will mostly crash as since there's npm installs. The code is for everyone to work on.
# Can I just steal any of this code?
No. Many people have worked on this bot for months now. Just no. Ask us before copying and pasting the code.

Because I noticed that there was no bot called PieBot in all of the discord bot lists, so guess what... I made it!
